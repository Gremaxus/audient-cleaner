# audient-cleaner

Made this tool since Audient refuses to fix their endless logging errors that report every second. Every second the .txt file increases in size, each file separated by session and over time takes up a lot of storage (first noticed when it surpassed 40GB after realizing there was an issue in my system somewhere). This is just a straightforward script that will automatically delete all the files in the directory where the logs are dumped continuously.
